### Product Overview:
### Target Buyer: 
Regional Store Managers like Mark, who oversee operations across multiple retail locations and are responsible for staffing, cost control, and store performance.
### Business Problem:
Mark is stuck juggling outdated workforce tools that can't forecast demand, leading to overstaffing during slow hours and understaffing during peak times. The result? Wasted labor costs, burnout among frontline staff, poor customer experiences, and missed revenue targets—plus traditional solutions are either too expensive or too complex to implement.
### Value Proposition:
The platform delivers intelligent labor forecasting and scheduling that integrates with existing HR systems, reduces turnover, and boosts revenue by aligning staffing with real-time and forecasted demand. It’s plug-and-play for ops teams and directly improves both the customer experience and employee retention—no technical degree required.
### ML Solution:
The solution uses a hybrid forecasting model (SVD-SARIMAX + ETS) to predict weekly sales trends with high accuracy, enabling smarter, data-driven staffing decisions. By integrating historical sales and economic indicators, it balances long-term patterns with real-time adaptability—automating the scheduling process across stores with minimal technical overhead.
### Result & Output of the Solution:
The model delivers a 12% cut in labor costs by reducing unnecessary part-time hires and a 15% boost in customer service efficiency by solving peak-hour understaffing. It scales effortlessly across 100+ retail locations, proving it's not just a pilot—it’s plug-and-play at enterprise scale.
### Business Model:
This is a SaaS-based subscription model with tiered pricing—$300/month for small stores, scaling up to $500/month for enterprise clients—designed to flex with business size and needs. Revenue is diversified through API licensing and consulting services for large-scale retailers, but the real growth engine is the subscription tier, built to scale.
### Investment Cycle:
With projected ROI hitting 70.53% by Year 3, the investment thesis is strong—subscription accounts are scaling fast: 40% YoY growth from enterprise, 20% from small stores, and 17% from midsize. Consulting and customization are strategic upsell levers, growing at 16% annually but kept secondary to maintain product-first scalability.
